# Instagram for Amazon
### Presentation and Analysis/Analytics by Lauren Coats
## Business Problem 
Amazon is an amazing company.  They are an important part to many peopleâ€™s lives around the world.  Amazon has quickly taken the place of brick and mortars everywhere.  The one thing Amazon does not have verses bricks and mortar is the ability to shop with friends.  There is nothing like using inspiration from a someone else to inspire your next purchase. Connecting people with like minded individuals is the next big step of virtual shopping experience. Amazon already has user profiles that shows previous reviews in one place. They have also seen the benefit of influencers using affiliate links to drive traffic to their site.  This recommendation system will recommend user instead of product to give Amazon more of a social media feel so you can buy directly from the site, eliminating the need for third party sites.
